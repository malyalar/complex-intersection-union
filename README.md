# Multi-Bounding Box Intersection-over-Union

Python script that calculates intersection over union for multi-bounding-box annotations between workers and valid experts. Works even if the number of boxes between worker and expert annotations is not equal. Also includes scripts to create an input URL .csv from buckets of images stored on Amazon S3 for manual annotation by MTurk Workers.

Also outputs approval rates and other analyses to a csv. Can loop through a csv-format MTurk submitted assignment batch, comparing all submitted assignment results to expert-validated results.

## Comments
The script converts MTurk image annotations from workers to (possibly downscaled) pixel arrays, with each element in the 2d array representing a pixel of the image that is either "marked" (1) or "unmarked" (0). For example, a 3100 * 3100 pixel image may be represented as a 310 * 310 2d array, for example. IOU is then calculated elementwise on these smaller representative arrays. Downscaling allows for large batches of images to be processed rapidly with insignificant error from loss of fidelity in the annotation data. Downscaling factor can be set to 1 for fully accurate calculations.

### Inputs

MTurk bounding-box worker annotations are written into batch_results.csv's as strings, representing an array of variable length (depending on how many boxes are drawn by the Worker):

[{"height":465,"label":"Stone","left":841,"top":570,"width":409},{"height":637,"label":"Stone","left":1703,"top":1680,"width":382},{"height":944,"label":"Stone","left":1186,"top":1801,"width":1518},{"height":287,"label":"Stone","left":1620,"top":1386,"width":472}]

"Expert" or ground-truth annotations are expected to be in the same format, under a column in the .csv titled, "expertAnswer" (rename this to whatever you like). Edit the "expert" section of the parse_dataframe() function to parse different string formats.

Intersection-over-union result is 15.99%. Agreement is written to batch_results.csv. (The image does not correspond to the input labels given above.)
